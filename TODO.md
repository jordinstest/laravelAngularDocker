# TODO

As this is a prove of concept,
this are the basic things I can remember now that we should improve:

### Frontend
- E2E test
- Better scaffolding
- Minification
- Npm install && bower install (to avoid commiting libs)
- Give feedbacks (like "saved correctly")

### Backend
- More testing
- Don't do inner join 

### Systems
- Remove unnecessary components from docker file
- Edit etc/hosts in install scripts
- Allow installation in linux
